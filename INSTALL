run compile.sh

it will create "gntdev"

now you can run that and play it in text mode

to avoid re-generating all those bitbases (which aren't really used yet anyway) bunzip the bitbases.dat.bz2

to use the web interface, make sure this directory has write privileges for the webserver user
* for standard strength, copy this to "gnt"
* for easy strength, you will have to compile a "gntez" variant, check the code if you really want to do this...
