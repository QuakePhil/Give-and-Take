run compile.sh

it will create "gntdev"

decompress the bitbases.dtm.bz2 (it will spend a long time generating them if you don't)

now you can run that and play it in text mode

to use the web interface, make sure this directory has write privileges for the webserver user
* for standard strength, copy "gntdev" to "gnt"
* for easy strength, you will have to compile a "gntez" variant, check the code if you really want to do this...
* that's dumb, I know :) easy strength was a hack and will be done more properly in the future (maybe.)

note: this is still a work in progress, so theres garbage code and debug code, hopefully most of it
is commented out and/or inactivated
